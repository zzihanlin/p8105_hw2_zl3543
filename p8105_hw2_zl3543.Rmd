# Read the CSV data file
subway_data <- read_csv("/Users/suwa/Desktop/p8105_hw2_zl3543/data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")

# Retain relevant columns and convert 'entry' to a logical variable
cleaned_data <- subway_data %>%
  select(line = `Line`, 
         station_name = `Station Name`, 
         station_latitude = `Station Latitude`, 
         station_longitude = `Station Longitude`, 
         routes = `Route1`:`Route11`,

# The dataset contains information about entrances and exits for each subway station in NYC. Key variables include 'line', 'station_name '(station name)', 'station_latitude', and 'station_longitude', 'routes', 'entry', 'vending', 'entrance_type', and 'ada_compliant'. For data cleaning, we retained only the relevant columns, renamed them for clarity, and converted the entry column from a character "YES"/"NO" to a logical 'TRUE'/'FALSE'. The resulting cleaned dataset has dimensions of [1868 rows x 19 columns], where row is the number of entries and column represents the selected variables. This dataset is tidy as each variable is in its own column, each observation is a row, and each cell contains a single value.
